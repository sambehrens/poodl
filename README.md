# Poodl

Welcome to Poodl!

**To get your development environment setup, follow the instructions below.**

_Before starting development, familiarize yourself with the merge strategy in the wiki_

### Ensure that you have yarn, npm, and node installed

If you are not sure if you do, type `yarn -v`, `npm -v`, and `node -v` and it will either say `command not found` or tell you a version number.

If any of the above are not installed, using homebrew, type `brew install yarn` or `brew install node`. npm comes with node

We are on `yarn 1`, `npm 6`, and `node 8`

Make sure you have the correct yarn installed

### Clone the repository onto your computer

`git clone <remote>`

### Install dependencies

`npm install && npm run client-install`

### Start development server

`yarn start:dev`

### Publish your changes

See the wiki page for our git merging strategy
